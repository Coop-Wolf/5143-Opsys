Left to do:
    1. Simulation IN PROGRESS
        - Will need to create script that will run a bunch of different simulations
        - with different parameters on different files, and output/display results
        - needed for calculations.
        - For every change made to the parameters, run every scheduler on it?
    2. Analyze Results (Avg wait, Turnaround time, etc) IN PROGRESS
    3. Write up
    4. Discussion Questions


Discussion Questions:
    Why is it valuable to separate the scheduler logic from the visualization layer?
    How could this design be extended to run two schedulers at once (for comparison)?
        The visualizer can accept two csv files and run them side by side on the screen.
    What information should the visualizer not have access to, and why?
        The visualizer should not know or have access to how the different schedulers work
        or what information they have, the visualizer should only know what to display.

Next Push to PROD:
    edit print_scheduler_stats_csv() function in base.py to include num ios and cpus
    edit main by adding csv_stats variable and writing to csv file
    Change naming from FileNum to Jobs

    Test Runs:
        main is able to generate its own jobs file
        run small simulation to check things are outputted to csv file.
        generate another job from generate_jobs.py
