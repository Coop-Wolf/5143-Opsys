this is a test to see how well my wc command works.
i am going to do some number of lines and words and characters 
i have noticed that running wc in the regular terminal doesnt
work correctly. it gave an extra line number while my program
produced the correct line count. Im going to use chatGPT to see
how many characters are in this text file because I dont want to 
count. That is all for now.
