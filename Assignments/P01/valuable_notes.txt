Work on next:
    1. Fix grep, go through grep commands that should work and test them
    1 Go through check list to make sure all work.
    2. Push updates to Tim shell.


Pushes to Production shell:
    fix parsed command
    edit grep help to include that there are flags -lic
    less needs to check that either input or params if present and not both.
    cp needs to check that there are exactly 2 params
    grep with flagsd


Need to fix:


Need to Add:
    fix output for !x


Errors (bugs):

    cp file1 is saying An unexpected error occurred. i think this is because there are no return statemnts withing so gettign overrettirn

    Error when running rm -rf bananas
        "Error deleting directory bananas: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: 'bananas'


Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat
    wc
    chmod
    date
    ip
    clear
    run


Reasons why some functions don't give the same result as the bash terminal:
    wc: bash terminal does not include numbers. Mine does, because Google Docs'
        word counter does as well.


Hardest part:
    The grep function was difficult when trying to count the number of lines and words when the input is a string. 
    Ls command took a while because there was a lot that went into that command, like multiple flags, human-readable size, and coloring files.

    Using the colors confused a much of functions that had to do processing on the strings
