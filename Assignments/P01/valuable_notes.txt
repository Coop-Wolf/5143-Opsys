Using man linux and copy and paste for there.
"&" at the end of a command is a backgroup process [not for sure yet if we'll be implementing this.]
sort command [sort <file>]
cat [file 1] [file 2] concatinates. can take zero or more files
chmod can do system call.

Work on next:
    test Commands
    add bonus stuff
        bonus ideas:
            1. command - Merica
                colors text red white and blue
            2. Ipconfig
            3. Uptime


Pushes to Production shell:
    


Need to fix:


Need to Add:
    if statement in cp(parts) to make sure there are 2 and only 2 params
        if len(params) < 1 or len(params) > 2:
            output["error"] = f"Error: cp takes only two params. 

Errors (bugs):
    cat valiable_notes.txt is printing 908 for word count when it should be 166
    Not sure if cat should read input. should just be a file. or input from previous command.


Added Features:
    colored info when doing ls depending on what type it is
    ls -merica
        colors list in red white blue


Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat
    wc
    chmod


Reasons why some functions dont give same result as bash terminal:
    wc: bash terminal does not include numbers. Mine does, because google docs
        word counter does as well.
