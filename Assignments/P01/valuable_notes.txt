Work on next:
    1 Copy new commands from Tim's shell.
    2. Test all commands.


Pushes to Production shell:
    mv function needs to check that there are only 2 parameters.
    Cat needs to take the whole parsed command (parts) not just file
    Then in the function it will check that input, params, and flags are null.
    More and Less needs to check if there is both input and params or neither and give error.
Need to fix:


Need to Add:
 

Errors (bugs):



Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat
    wc
    chmod
    date
    ip
    clear
    run


Reasons why some functions don't give the same result as the bash terminal:
    wc: bash terminal does not include numbers. Mine does, because Google Docs'
        word counter does as well.


Hardest part:
    The grep function was difficult when trying to count the number of lines and words when the input is a string. 
    Ls command took a while because there was a lot that went into that command, like multiple flags, human-readable size, and coloring files.
