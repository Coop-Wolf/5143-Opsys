Using man linux and copy and paste for there.
"&" at the end of a command is a backgroup process [not for sure yet if we'll be implementing this.]
sort command [sort <file>]
cat [file 1] [file 2] concatinates. can take zero or more files
chmod can do system call.

Work on next:

    1. Test Commands



Pushes to Production shell:

    1. Fix welcome function

    2. To set date to CDT
        2.1. run command in temrinal:
            2.1.1. export TZ=America/Chicago
        2.2. Verify fix:
            2.2.1. date

    3. run, commands function
       run, commands help
       run, commands in main
       run, commands in command list


Need to fix:
    coope@CooperPC:/home/coope/OS/5143-Opsys/Assignments/P01$ sort test.txt

        File "/home/coope/OS/5143-Opsys/Assignments/P01/shell2.py", line 921, in sort
        sorted_list.append()
    TypeError: list.append() takes exactly one argument (0 given)

Need to Add:
 

Errors (bugs):
    cat valiable_notes.txt is printing 908 for word count when it should be 166
    Not sure if cat should read input. should just be a file. or input from previous command.


Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat
    wc
    chmod
    date
    ip
    clear
    run


Reasons why some functions dont give same result as bash terminal:
    wc: bash terminal does not include numbers. Mine does, because google docs
        word counter does as well.
