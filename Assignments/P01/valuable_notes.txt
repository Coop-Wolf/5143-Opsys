Using man linux and copy and paste for there.
"&" at the end of a command is a backgroup process [not for sure yet if we'll be implementing this.]
sort command [sort <file>]
cat [file 1] [file 2] concatinates. can take zero or more files
chmod can do system call.

Work on next:

    try to get firefox to work in wsl. 
    need to fix the diverging paths stuff.

    1. Test Commands
    2. Add bonus stuff
        2.1 Bonus ideas:



Pushes to Production shell:

    1. Fix welcome function

    2. To set date to CDT
        2.1. run command in temrinal:
            2.1.1. export TZ=America/Chicago
        2.2. Verify fix:
            2.2.1. date


Need to fix:


Need to Add:
 

Errors (bugs):
    cat valiable_notes.txt is printing 908 for word count when it should be 166
    Not sure if cat should read input. should just be a file. or input from previous command.


Added Features:
    colored info when doing ls depending on what type it is
    ls -merica
        colors list in red white blue
    ip command
    date


Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat
    wc
    chmod
    date
    ip
    clear


Reasons why some functions dont give same result as bash terminal:
    wc: bash terminal does not include numbers. Mine does, because google docs
        word counter does as well.
