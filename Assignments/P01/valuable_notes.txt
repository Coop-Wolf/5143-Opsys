for piping. split the command using split("|")

Using man linux and copy and paste for there.

"&" at the end of a command is a backgroup process [not for sure yet]

functions needs to return strings and have no arguments

sort command [sort <file>]

cat [file 1] [file 2] concatinates. can take zero or more files

wc without params. words lines and characters. 

chmod can do system call.

have to keep a history that survives when shell detailed [CHECK]
    - history has line numbers
    - have a history.txt file that reads it in and loads into list.
    - append command to the list and auto write out so if shell breaks all those previous commands are in there
    - starting shell and hitting up arrow should go to 



run like a real command shell.

rich does colors tabular data.




Errors (bugs):
    ls isn't printing the correct total: size.
    up and down arrows aren't exactly correct
        going up 2, then going down 1 will
        display one command up instead of goind down



Added Features:
    left and right arrows
    colored info when doing ls depending on what type it is


Commands that work correctly:
    history
    mkdir
    cd (with or without arguments)
    pwd
    ls -a
    ls -l
    ls -al
    exit
    !x


Need to do error testing on all commands to make sure errors are handled properly


Issues:
    Running into problems with the history.txt file
    Been running the shell py in wsl on path /home/coope/OS/
    This is where ive cloned my repository.
    Doing dev through vs code and running commits that sync changes to wsl directory
    However when adding the history.txt file and trying to write out to it.
    that file its writing out to is scored on the wsl directory only and needs to be
    pushed to the github repo. When trying to do this i have to entry my username and password
    but github has made changes where the password has to be a token. I created the token thorugh dev
    settings in github but showed to be invalid when trying to enter in when prompted for password in order
    to push the history.txt. 
    Not been able to figure that out. 
    Right now im going to run the shell through vs code and save the history.txt file to the correct place where
    it copies directory and I don't have to push.
