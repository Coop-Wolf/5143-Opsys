Using man linux and copy and paste for there.
"&" at the end of a command is a backgroup process [not for sure yet if we'll be implementing this.]
sort command [sort <file>]
cat [file 1] [file 2] concatinates. can take zero or more files
chmod can do system call.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Work on next:
    chmod
    <
    >


Pushes to Production shell:
    push sort implementation
    add help for it
    add in main


Need to fix:

    wc isnt functioning correctly. need to do same implementation for the with open look.
    the problem is that its not behaving correctly when there is a new line at the last line
    of the file.

    wc needs to read std in when no input or file is provided. (not a high priority)


Need to Add:
    if statement in cp(parts) to make sure there are 2 and only 2 params
        if len(params) < 1 or len(params) > 2:
            output["error"] = f"Error: cp takes only two params. 

Errors (bugs):
    cat valiable_notes.txt is printing 908 for word count when it should be 166
    Not sure if cat should read input. should just be a file. or input from previous command.


Added Features:
    colored info when doing ls depending on what type it is


Commands that work correctly for Shell2.py
    ls -alh
    cd 
    cd ..
    cd directory
    pwd
    mkdir
    history
    !x
    exit
    sort
    cat


Cool stuff:
    terminal wc doesn't run correctly. 
    when running in the regular shell: wc test.txt: it says there are 6 lines but there are really 7
    my wc command gets the correct result for the line numeber.
