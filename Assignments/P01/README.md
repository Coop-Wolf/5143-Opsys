Questions for Griffen so I dont't forget.
    Do we been to display the current directory to the left of the "%"

Ideas:
    Change colors depending of File | Folder | Executable
    Allow user to input "up" and "down" arrow to get previously used commands

Next:
    ls -arg implementation
    mkdir
