## Overview

In this project, we will implement a basic "shell". A shell is a command-line interface we often interact with, and provides an powerful interface with your system. Below is an overview of the actions our shell will perform:

1. Print a prompt(`$: `) to the user.
2. Read a command line from stdin.
3. Tokenize (lexically analyze) the command a create an array of command parts (tokens).
4. Parse the token array to identify the command and its arguments.

## Requirements

- **Language**: Python

- **Command Features**:
    - Each command returns a string.
    - Commands can accept input from other commands.

Our shell will support the following command types:

### 1. **Exit Command**

- **Command**: `exit`
- **Description**: Terminates the shell.
- **Concepts**: Exiting the shell with system calls like exit().

### 2. **Command without Arguments**

- **Example**: `ls`
- **Description**: Executes a command without arguments and waits for it to complete.
- **Concepts**: Synchronous execution, process forking.

### 3. **Command with Arguments**

- **Example**: `ls -l`
- **Description**: Parses command-line arguments and executes the command.
- **Concepts**: Command-line paramaters.

### 4. **Output Redirection**

- **Example**: `ls > output.txt`
- **Description**: Redirects the command output to a specified file.
- **Concepts**: File operations, output redirection.

### 5. **Input Redirection**

- **Example**: `sort < inputfile.txt`
- **Description**: Takes input from a file instead of the userâ€™s input.
- **Concepts**: File operations, input redirection.

### 6. **Piping Commands**

- **Example**: `ls -l | more`
- **Description**: Passes the output of one command as input to another command.
- **Concepts**: Pipes, synchronous operations.

## Instructions:
- Clone the repository or connect through GitHub CodeSpaces in VS Code
- Locate the directory where the program exists
- Run `shell2.py` in the terminal using command: `python3 shell2.py` or `python shell2.py`
- A welcome message will be displayed as well as a prompt where you may begin execute the commands below

|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| _cd ~_               |   broke the shell      | If statement containing piping syntax was misaligned in code |                            
| ll                   |   broke the shell      | "                                                           " |

| less h q / ?   |   breaks the shell     | added help buffer/created display buffer copy earlier to allow display  buffer reference swap | 
| grep as as file.txt  |   grep was trying to process mul patterns |   only allow for a single patterns without flag |

## Highs and Lows:
- Highs
  - Cooper
    - The first time piping worked
    - Finally figuring out the 'grep' command
    - When our second presentation went well
    - Adding the extra features and having them work
- Lows
  - Cooper
    - Grep command kept failing
    - Figuring out the arrow keys
    - When the first presentation didn't go as expected

## Extras:
- Color ls contents if they are directory or executable
- 'ls -merica' colors list contents red white and blue
- date command that displays date and time
- clear command that clears the screen
- ip command that displays ip address
- run command runs an application
